# Iforgor

Have you ever suddenly forgotten the exact syntax of a structure, or a list or a function or whatever in a specific language ?
This happens to me all the time, so i created "iforgor", a simple python tool to display the syntax as well as information about a specific piece of code, without wasting my precious time checking on the internet.


# How to use it ?


iforgor.py LANGUAGE PIECEOFCODE

Example:

# Installation

cd into the directory you want to install into.

Run the following:

cd iforgor

./setup.sh

*Now. Close the terminal and reopen it.*

Now try to run iforgor.py -h.

If it works congratulation, its setup!
