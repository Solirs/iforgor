# Iforgor

Have you ever suddenly forgotten the exact syntax of a structure, or a list or a function or whatever in a specific language ?
This happens to me all the time, so i created "iforgor", a simple python tool to display the syntax as well as information about a specific piece of code, without wasting my precious time checking on the internet.


# How to use it ?


python3 iforgor.py -LANGUAGE PIECEOFCODE (can be a list, struct, whatever)

Example:

python3 iforgor.py -C struct

#Planned features:

Setup script to add iforgor to path.
